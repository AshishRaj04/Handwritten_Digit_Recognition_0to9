# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks
**This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using a neural network. We'll be using a dataset containing 5000 training examples of handwritten digits (0-9), each represented as a 20x20 pixel grayscale image. The task is a multiclass classification problem where the goal is to classify each image into one of the ten possible classes.**

## Packages Used
We'll be using the following Python libraries:
- numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- tensorflow: For building and training neural networks.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- tensorflow: For building our neural network

  ## Problem Statement
  **Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today, ranging from recognizing zip codes on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. Our goal is to build a neural network that can accurately classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9.**

  ## Dataset
  **The dataset consists of 5000 training examples of handwritten digits, each represented as a 20x20 pixel grayscale image. Additionally, there is a 5000x1 dimensional vector y that contains labels for the training set, where y = 0 if the image is of the digit 0, y = 4 if the image is of the digit 4, and so on.**
